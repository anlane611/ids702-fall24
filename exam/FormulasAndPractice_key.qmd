### Short answer

16. This question uses a dataset containing information on 150 births in North Carolina in 2004.

**Codebook:**

**m_age**

:   Mother's age.

**weeks**

:   Weeks at which the mother gave birth.

**premature**

:   Indicates whether the baby was premature or not.

**weight**

:   Birth weight of the baby (lbs).

**Smoke**

:   Whether or not the mother was a smoker.

```{r, warning = F, message = F, echo=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(tidymodels)
library(openintro)
data("births")

births_sub <- births |> 
  select(c("m_age","weeks","premature","weight","smoke"))


glimpse(births_sub)
```

a\. Which two variables in the births dataset can NOT be used as an outcome in a linear regression model? Justify your answer and assume that you have cleaned the dataset.

\vspace{1cm}

"premature" and "Smoke" variables cannot be used as an outcome in a linear regression since they do not take on numerical values. Instead, they are categorical with 2 levels.

\vspace{2cm}

b\. Write the theoretical model that regresses `weight` on `m_age`, `weeks`, and `premature`. Be sure to define each term (i.e., "Y= —–").

\vspace{1cm}

$Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \beta_3 x_3 + \epsilon$

where $Y$ is weight in pounds;

$x_1$ - mothers age in years,

$x_2$ - weeks at which birth was given,

$x_3$ is 1 if the baby was premature and 0 otherwise.

\vspace{2cm}

c\. Using the output below, write the fitted model.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
MLRmod <- linear_reg() |>
  set_engine("lm") |>
  fit(weight~m_age+weeks+premature, data=births)

tidy(MLRmod)
```

\vspace{1cm}

$\hat{Y} = -4.35 + 0.03 x_1 + 0.28 x_2 -1.01 x_3$.

\vspace{2cm}

d\. Write interpretations for the coefficient estimates of the `weeks` and `premature` variables.

\vspace{1cm}

`weeks`:

Controlling for mother's age and whether the baby was premature, for every week increase at which the mother gave birth, the weight increases by 0.28 lbs on average.

\vspace{2cm}

`premature`:

Controlling for mothers age and weeks at which the mother gave birth, premature babies weigh 1.01 lbs pounds less than full term babies, on average.

\vspace{2cm}

\newpage

e\. Write the theoretical model in mathematical notation that best matches the plot shown below. Be sure to define each term.

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
ggplot(births, aes(x=weeks,y=weight,color=smoke))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(method="lm",se=F)+
  labs(x="Weeks of gestation",y="Birth weight",color="Smoking status")
```

\vspace{1cm}

$Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \beta_3 x_1 x_2 + \epsilon$

where $Y$ is weight in pounds;

$x_1$ - weeks of gestation;

$x_2$ is 1 when Smoke = "smoker", 0 otherwise.

\vspace{4cm}

f\. Write the implied linear models in mathematical notation for each level of smoking status. You do not need to define the terms again.

\vspace{1cm}

-   Smoker: $Y = ( \beta_0 + \beta_2) + (\beta_1 + \beta_3)x_1 + \epsilon$

\vspace{1cm}

-   Nonsmoker: $Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \epsilon$

\vspace{3cm}

g\. In 2-3 sentences, describe what is being compared with the code below and the conclusion you can draw using the output.

```{r}
Mod1 <- lm(weight~weeks+smoke, data=births)

Mod2 <- lm(weight~weeks*smoke, data=births)

summary(Mod1)$adj.r.squared
summary(Mod2)$adj.r.squared

anova(Mod1, Mod2, test="F")
```

Two models are being compared: one without an interaction term between weeks and smoke, and one with an interaction term. The model with the interaction term has a higher adjusted $R^2$ , so it explains more variability in the outcome, and the nested F test is statistically significant. Therefore, we can conclude that the interaction term is valuable in this case. (This matches what we saw in the plot in part e)

17. **Answer each question in no more than 1-2 sentences.**

a\. What is a sampling distribution?

\vspace{1cm}

The probability distribution that describes the distribution of the sample statistic.

\vspace{3cm}

b\. How are the concepts of bootstrapping and sampling distributions related?

\vspace{1cm}

Bootstrapping is a way to simulate the sampling distribution when the population distribution is not known and we do not have the resources to collect several samples.

\vspace{3cm}

c\. How is the central limit theorem related to the concept of a sampling distribution?

\vspace{1cm}

The CLT states that the sampling distribution of the sample mean is $N(\mu, \sigma/\sqrt n)$ when the two conditions are met: observations in the sample are independent and the sample is large enough.
