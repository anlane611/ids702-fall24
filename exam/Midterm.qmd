**General Information**:

-   The midterm will cover all of Unit 1 and the first two weeks of Unit 2. Topics covered on 10/8 and 10/10 will not be on the midterm. A more detailed list of topics is provided below.

-   The midterm will have a combination of multiple choice questions and short answer questions

-   You will be provided with a formula sheet for reference. The formula sheet that you will have is given with the practice questions.

-   You will not be able to use any additional materials (e.g., notes, electronic devices)

-   A review session will be held on Oct 17 during class to go over the practice questions

-   You will not have to answer any questions about R syntax (i.e., writing code). You will be expected to interpret R output. Examples of this are given in the practice questions.

-   If you have been approved for testing accommodations, please reach out to me and/or the testing center to make arrangements as soon as possible (if you have not done so already). These arrangements cannot be made at the last minute; the testing center has to approve the reservations and fills up quickly.
