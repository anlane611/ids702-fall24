## Short Answer

### Question 16 (12 points)

You conduct a two-sample t-test to compare the mean full-value property tax rate per \$10,000 for Boston homes that are bordered by the Charles River vs. those that are not. You obtain the following results:

Mean tax rate for homes that do not border the river: 409.9

Mean tax rate for homes that border the river: 386.3

Sample statistic: 23.6

p-value: 0.42

95% confidence interval: \[-34.9, 82.2\]

significance level: 0.05

\vspace{1cm}

a\. State whether or not the p-value interpretations given below are correct or incorrect. If the interpretation is incorrect, identify why that is the case.

i.  The probability that the null hypothesis is true is 0.42. Therefore, we can accept the null hypothesis that the mean tax rate is equal for houses that border the river and houses that do not border the river.

Incorrect - p-value is not the probability that the null is true, and we do not accept the null hypothesis

\vspace{1cm}

ii. Assuming that there is a difference in the mean tax rate between houses that border the river and houses that do not, the probability of observing data equal to or more extreme than what we observe is 0.42. Therefore, we reject the null hypothesis that the mean tax rate is equal for houses that border the river and houses that do not border the river.

Incorrect - we do not assume the alternative, and we would not reject the null here (0.42\>0.05)

\vspace{1cm}

b\. State whether or not the 95% confidence interval interpretations given below are correct or incorrect. If the interpretation is incorrect, identify why that is the case.

i.  There is a 95% probability that the true difference in mean tax rate between houses that do not border the river and houses that do is between -34.9 and 82.2.

Incorrect - CI does not capture a probability because the true difference is not random

\vspace{1cm}

ii. There is a 95% probability that the observed difference in mean tax rate between houses that do not border the river and houses that do is between -34.9 and 82.2.

Incorrect - CI does not capture a probability and the observed difference is always in the CI

### Question 17 (15 points)

A dataset contains information about 134 selected countries. The variables in the dataset are listed below. You want to understand the factors that are related to life expectancy.

**Codebook:**

Life.expectancy

:   Average life expectancy (years)

infant.deaths

:   Number of infant deaths per 1000

Hepatitis.B

:   Hepatitis B immunization rate in infants (%)

Status

:   Economic categorization (developed or developing)

Measles

:   Number of reported measles cases per 1000

First, you fit a model regressing life expectancy on infant deaths, Measles, Hepatitis B, and Status. Use the output shown below to answer questions a and b.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
LifeData <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anlane611/sta101_spr23_website/main/Exam1Data.csv")

summary(lm(Life.expectancy~infant.deaths+Measles+Hepatitis.B+Status, 
           data=LifeData))$coefficients
```

a\. Write the fitted model.

\vspace{3cm}

b\. Write an interpretation for the coefficient estimate of the Status variable.

\vspace{3cm}

Next, you fit a model regressing life expectancy on infant deaths, Measles, Hepatitis B, status, and an interaction term for infant deaths and status. Answer questions c-e based on this model.

c\. Write the full theoretical model. Be sure to define each term (e.g., "Y = —–")

\vspace{3cm}

{{< pagebreak >}}

d\. Write the implied theoretical models for developed and developing countries. You do not need to define the terms again.

Developed:

\vspace{3cm}

Developing:

\vspace{3cm}

e\. What is the dimension of the design matrix for this model?
