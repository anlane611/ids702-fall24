If that's the case, focus on the high-level ideas. By the end of the reading, you should be able to answer the following questions:\n\n-   What is the input of a probability distribution function? What is the output?\n\n-   What is the difference between a cumulative density function and a probability density function?\n\n-   What am I describing if I refer to the expected value of a distribution?\n\n-   How are discrete and continuous random variables similar and how are they different?\n",
