If that's the case, focus on the high-level ideas. By the end of the reading, you should be able to answer the following questions:\n\n-   What is the input of a probability distribution function? What is the output?\n\n-   What is the difference between a cumulative density function and a probability density function?\n\n-   What am I describing if I refer to the expected value of a distribution?\n\n-   How are discrete and continuous random variables similar and how are they different?\n\n## Class Recap & Exercise\n\n[Slides](Distributions_slides-speaker.html)\n\n[Groups for the exercise](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16Eed60rRnipqaPwrCnzAiLTd66RNS5T9N3ohW0Fq4xY/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n[Google slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/13C32G2ci6cicOZlKZCKrUhF1UZKv8OWWvbCDm0Zkb10/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n## Extra Practice\n\n[Distributome Game](http://distributome.org/V3/DistributomeGame.html)\n",
