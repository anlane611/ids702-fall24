Conceptually, it's the \"nothing special is going on\" hypothesis.\n\n-   Alternative ($H_A$): A statement that is contradictory to the null hypothesis. Conceptually, it is the \"something special is going on\" or \"the variables are associated\" hypothesis.\n\n## Poll\n\nAs we test the hypotheses, do you think it would be better scientific practice to operate under the assumption that the null hypothesis is true (i.e., nothing special is going on) or that the alternative hypothesis is true (something special is going on/the variables are related)?\n\nFor example, imagine you work for the FDA and you are assessing whether or not a new drug should be approved. Do you think it is better practice to 1) assume that the drug **is not** effective until the data prove otherwise, or 2) assume that the drug **is** effective until the data prove otherwise?\n\n## Hypothesis testing framework\n\n-   Start with two hypotheses about the population: $H_0$ (null) and $H_A$ (alternative).\n-   Choose a representative sample.\n-   Assess **how likely** the sample data can be observed **given that the** $H_0$ is true.\n-   If the data are very unlikely to be observed when $H_0$ is true, then we reject $H_0$; otherwise, we cannot reject the null hypothesis.\n\n## P-value\n\nThe probability of **observing the data or even more extreme values** assuming that $H_0$ is true.\n\n-   $H_0:\\mu=0;H_A:\\mu>0$.\n-   Then p-value $=P(X>x_{obs})$ when $\\mu=0$\n-   It is **NOT** the probability of $H_0$ is true\n-   What if $H_A: \\mu \\neq 0$ ?\n\n## P-value\n\nWhich region of the plot below constitutes the p-value?\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](InferenceI_slides_files/figure-revealjs/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## Significance level\n\nA predetermined threshold used to tell whether a result is statistically significant; usually denoted by $\\alpha$ and set as 0.05.\n\n-   If the p-value is smaller than $\\alpha=0.05$, then we can reject $H_0$ at 0.05-significant level.\n-   If the p-value is greater than $\\alpha=0.05$, then we fail to reject $H_0$ at 0.05-significant level.\n\n. . .\n\nNote: **We can NEVER say we accept the null hypothesis**, even if the p-value is greater than the significance level.\n\n## Simulation-based Inference vs. Parametric Inference\n\nSimulation-based inference\n\n-   Simulate the null distribution with resampling methods\n\n-   Very flexible, but requires computation power\n\n. . .\n\nParametric Inference\n\n-   Make assumptions about the probability distribution of our population\n\n-   Relies on statistical theory such as central limit theorem\n\n## Why learn both approaches?\n\n-   Simulation-based inference can be intuitive, and is more flexible\n\n-   Parametric inference has been around for a long time and you will likely see it more in practice\n",
