Now imagine that we could not actually obtain all of these data. Instead, we were only able to obtain a sample of 200 babies. Using only a sample of 200, if we fit a line in the same way as above, we have many different lines that we could have obtained:\n\nset.seed(823)\nbirths_sample1 &lt;- births14 |&gt; slice_sample(n=200)\n\nggplot(births_sample1, aes(x=weeks, y=weight))+\n  geom_point()+\n  labs(x=\"length of pregnancy (weeks)\",y=\"baby weight (lbs)\")+\n  geom_smooth(method=\"lm\",se=F)\n\nmod_sample1 &lt;- linear_reg() |&gt; \n  set_engine(\"lm\") |&gt;\n  fit(weight ~ weeks, data=births_sample1)\n\ntidy(mod_sample1, conf.int=TRUE)\n\n\n\nExercise\nFill in the code below to simulate the process of taking 250 different samples and store the weeks coefficient estimate in a vector\n\nweeks.coefs &lt;- c() #create empty vector to store coefficient estimates\n\nfor(i in 1:250){ #create loop for 250 different samples\n  print(i)\n  set.seed(823+i) #set a unique seed each iteration\n  \n  #sample data\n  births_sample &lt;-\n  \n  #fit model\n  mod_sample &lt;- \n    \n  #store output\n  weeks.coefs[i] &lt;- tidy(mod_sample)$estimate[2]\n}\n\n \n \n \nNow let’s plot the coefficient estimates we have for the 250 samples:\n\nweeks.coefs.dat &lt;- data.frame(weeks.coefs)\n\nggplot(weeks.coefs.dat, aes(x=weeks.coefs))+\n  geom_histogram()+\n  labs(x=\"weeks coefficient estimate\")\n\nWe see that there is variability in the coefficient estimates for weeks. The standard deviation of this collection of possible estimates is the standard error of the estimate.\n\n\nConfidence interval and p-value\nWe can also use this collection of estimates to provide a plausible range for the “true” coefficient value:\n\nquantile(weeks.coefs, probs=c(.025,.975))\n\nOr, we can look at the collection of estimates and see that none of them are 0. So, because we collected 250 different samples and none of them had a coefficient estimate of 0, we are quite confident that the “true” coefficient is not zero.\n \n \nIn reality, we typically cannot many samples from the same population. So, we often rely on assumptions related to probability distributions to derive confidence intervals and p-values."

Let’s say we want to create a new numeric variable that collapses the Languages variable into 3 categories using the following values:\n0: 0 languages\n1: 1-3 languages\n2: 4 or more languages\nFirst, we need to create a numeric version of the Languages variable since we have a value of “10 or more”\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nWe can perform a quality control check by computing the min and max of the numeric variable for each level of the categorical variable. If the minimum and maximum fit within the desired range for each level, then we have created it correctly.\n\n\nSushi (outliers/implausible values)\nNow consider the sushi variable. Based on our glimpse output, we have integer values. Let’s check the minimum and maximum values.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nIt’s important to pay attention to implausible values. What would be an implausible value in this case? How should we handle it?\nValues below 0 are implausible. 999 is also likely implausible because the respondent would have had to eat sushi more than 33 times each day, on average. Note, however, that values above 30 are not necessarily implausible because the question just asked how many times you’ve eaten sushi, not on how many days you ate sushi. The value 14 could be an outlier, but it is not implausible. We do not remove values just because they are outliers.\nFor the quality control check, let’s use the summary function. This shows us that the minimum is 0, the maximum is 14, and there are two missing values. This is a base R function, so we need to use the $ symbol to designate the variable instead of using the pipe operator |&gt;\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.",

    "text": "Course Components\n\nClass preparation\nBefore each class meeting, you will be required to engage with prep materials (reading or video). The prep materials will primarily cover theoretical modeling concepts. Class meetings will then focus on implementation in R and application exercises. Preparation assignments will be posted on the course website.\nTo ensure that you engage with the class preparation, we will have random comprehension quizzes throughout the semester. These quizzes will take place at the beginning of class and will count as part of your participation grade (cumulative score &gt;80% will earn full credit).\nThe preparation course component connects to the first two learning objectives.\n\n\nApplication exercises\nDuring class meetings, you will complete application exercises. These exercises will focus on deepening your understanding of the theoretical concepts and help you to apply the concepts in R. You will work on these exercises in groups and submit it at the end of the class session. They will be graded on the following scale:\n0: Exercise was not submitted\n1: Exercise was submitted but does not present a good faith effort\n2: Exercise was submitted and presents a good faith effort\nA “good faith effort” means that the exercise may not be completely correct, or may be missing a couple of components, but it is clear that students worked diligently and engaged in the learning process.\nThe preparation course component connects to the first, second, and fourth learning objectives.\n\n\nHomework assignments\nYou will have five homework assignments to complete during the semester; they will each cover roughly two weeks of material. The structure of the assignments will evolve with the course material, starting with a problem set structure and moving toward written analysis assignments.\nYou are encouraged to talk to each other about general concepts, and to the instructor/TAs. However, the write-ups, solutions, and code MUST be entirely your own work. The assignments must be typed up using Quarto and submitted on Gradescope. Note that you will not be able to make online submissions after the due date, so be sure to submit before the Gradescope-specified deadline.\nHomework assignments connect to all five learning objectives.\n\n\nStatistics reflections\nYou will be responsible for four statistics reflections throughout the semester. I have assigned six pieces that cover various topics related to the interaction between data science and society. You are to write a written reflection about the material that you select. Questions are provided as prompts, but you are not required to answer them in your reflection. Grades will be based on completion and thoughtful engagement.\nThe chosen articles/videos address topics that may be sensitive and/or uncomfortable, including racism, eugenics, and gender identity. It is crucial that you engage in the reflections thoughtfully and respectfully. I seek to create a classroom environment that not only acknowledges diversity in all forms, but celebrates it. In that endeavor, I would be remiss not to acknowledge the discriminatory ways statistical science has been used both historically and currently. In having these important discussions, I want you to critically examine and appreciate the power (good and bad) of statistics as you begin your career as a data scientist. More information can be found on the statistics reflections page on the course website.\nStatistics reflections connect to the fourth course learning objective.\n\n\nMidterm exam\nA midterm exam will be held on Tuesday, October 22, in class, and cover the first two units: statistics fundamentals and linear regression. The exam will assess conceptual understanding, not R programming.\nIf you benefit from the use of testing accommodations, such as an isolated testing area or extra time, please connect with the Student Disability Access Office as soon as possible.\nThe exam connects to the first and second learning objectives.\n\n\nProject\nYou will work with a team to apply the knowledge and skills learned throughout this course and analyze a dataset that interests you. The project should be an in-depth statistical analysis of a particular research question. Your team will select the dataset. Teams will be assigned. More detailed information will be available on the course website later in the semester. The project will have the following components:\n\nProposal (team)\nWritten report (team)\nRecorded elevator pitch (individual)\nTeam member evaluation\n\nThe project connects to all four course learning objectives.",

You will lose 100% of the total points if you submit later than that without explicit approval from the instructor.\nYou can request a single-use, no-questions-asked 24-hour extension for one assignment (either homework assignment or statistics reflection) during the semester. To use your extension, email the instructor and cc all TAs with the subject line “IDS 702 Single-use Extension.” No explanation is needed as to why you are requesting the extension. The extension cannot be applied to the exam, project deliverables, or prep material quizzes.\n\n\nAcademic integrity\nAs a student in this course, you have agreed to uphold the Duke Community Standard as well as the practices specific to this course. This means that the work you submit is your own, even if you discuss assignments with your classmates. Additionally, when consulting resources (books, internet articles including stackexchange, chatgpt), you must cite them. If you have any questions about what should be cited in your work, please reach out to the instructor.\nPlease read Nick Eubank’s ChatGPT advice linked here and consider the downside of overreliance on LLMs during the learning process.\n\n\nInclusive community\nIt is my intent that students from all diverse backgrounds and perspectives be well-served by this course, that students’ learning needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity that the students bring to this class be viewed as a resource, strength, and benefit. It is my intent to present materials and activities that are respectful of diversity and in alignment with Duke’s commitment to diversity and inclusion. Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated. Please let me know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally, or for other students or student groups.\nFurthermore, I would like to create a learning environment for my students that supports a diversity of thoughts, perspectives and experiences, and honors your identities. To help accomplish this:\n\nIf you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by your experiences outside of class, please don’t hesitate to come and talk with me. If you prefer to speak with someone outside of the course, I encourage you to speak with MIDS administrators.\nI (like many people) am still in the process of learning about diverse perspectives and identities. If something was said in class (by anyone) that made you feel uncomfortable, please let me or a member of the teaching team know.",

You can use the suggested questions to get started, but you are not required to answer them in your response.\nIn Gradescope, select the appropriate reflection assignment based on the due date. All of the assignments are already available, so you can complete them at any time!\n\nI am always available if you have any questions or comments about the content presented in these materials. Additionally, if you come across a piece that is not on this list and you would like to use it for a statistics reflection, you are welcome to send me an email.

You must show your work/justify your answers to receive credit.\nClick here to download the template (right click and choose “save link as”)\n \n\n(8 points) Use the following information to answer each question below: \\(P(A) = 0.2\\), \\(P(B)=0.4\\), \\(P(A \\cap B)=0.08\\)\na. What is \\(P(A|B)\\)?\nb. What is \\(P(A \\cup B)\\)?\nc. Are \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) mutually exclusive?\nd. Are \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) independent?\n\n \n \n\n(8 points) In 2023, 20% of a local bank’s credit card holders experienced fraud that forced them to cancel their cards. The bank expects to bring in 200 new customers in 2024. They want to know how many new cards they will have to cancel, assuming the probability of fraud is consistent for both years.\na. Which probability distribution best fits this situation?\nb. How many customers should they expect to experience fraud?\nc. What is the probability that 50 customers will experience fraud?\nd. What is the probability that no more than 50 customers will experience fraud?\n\n \n \n\n(36 points) All about the samples: In this exercise, you will conduct a simulation in R to evaluate the effect of sample size and sampling schemes on the sampling distribution of the mean.\n\nWe will use the dataset provided below to conduct the simulation. The dataset contains 100000 observations, so we will treat this as our population of interest. The dataset has 3 variables: 1 continuous variable (Y) and 2 categorical variables (X1 and X2).\n\npopulation &lt;- read.csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anlane611/datasets/main/population.csv\", header=TRUE)\n\nFirst, let’s understand our population. Our main variable of interest will be Y.\na. What is the mean of Y?\nb. What is the mean of Y for each level of X1? How many observations are in each level of X1?\nc. What is the mean of Y for each level of X2? How many observations are in each level of X2?\n \nNow, explore the sampling distribution of the sample mean of Y under simple random sampling.\nd. Use the skeleton code below to simulate the process of collecting 1000 simple random samples, each of size 10, from the population. Generate a histogram of the 1000 sample means and describe what you observe. Does the histogram show an approximately normal distribution? What is its mean and how does it compare to the population mean?\n\nSRSmeans &lt;- data.frame(means=NA) #create an empty dataframe to store the sample means\nfor(i in 1:1000){\n  set.seed(i) #ensure that we have a different sample each time\n  SRS.sample &lt;- __________ |&gt; slice(sample(1:________,size=__))\n  SRSmeans[i,1] &lt;- SRS.sample |&gt; summarise(______(Y))\n}\n\nggplot(SRSmeans, aes(x=means)) +\n  geom_histogram()+\n  labs(title=\"_____________\")\n\ne. Simulate the process of collecting 1000 simple random samples, but this time each should be of size 100. Generate a histogram of the sample means. What is the difference between this histogram and the histogram you generated in part d?\n \nNext, explore the sampling distribution of the sample mean of Y under cluster sampling.\nf. Simulate the process of collecting 1000 cluster samples, where each sample is comprised of 2 randomly-selected clusters from X1. Generate a histogram of the samples means and describe what you observe. What is the mean of the sampling distribution? Is the sampling distribution approximately normal?\n \nFinally, explore the sampling distribution of the sample mean of Y under stratified sampling.\ng. Simulate the process of collecting 1000 stratified samples, where each sample is comprised of a random sample of size 100 drawn from each stratum, and X1 is the strata variable. Generate a histogram of the sample means and describe what you observe. What is the mean of the sampling distribution? Is the sampling distribution approximately normal?\nh. Simulate the process of collecting 1000 stratified samples, where each sample is comprised of a random sample of size 100 drawn from each stratum, and X2 is the strata variable. Generate a histogram of the sample means and describe what you observe. What is the mean of the sampling distribution? Is the sampling distribution approximately normal?\ni. Compare and contrast the results from g and h. Consider the results from parts b and c. What can you conclude about the sampling distribution of the sample mean under stratified sampling?\n \nBonus (5pts): Considering your results from parts f-i, what can you say about the sampling distribution under multistage sampling? You do not need to run the simulation, but your answer should be well-substantiated.",

Access the help file for the dataset using ?Wage to see the codebook.\n\nGenerate a histogram of the workers’ raw wages in 2008. Based on the histogram of this sample of wages, do you think the true distribution of 2008 wages is approximately normal? (Note that this can be justified either way, but you need to explain your reasoning for your choice)\n\nWage.2008 &lt;- Wage |&gt; \n  filter(year==2008)\n\nggplot(Wage.2008, aes(x=wage))+\n  geom_histogram()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJustification for: Yes, the distribution appears to be approximately normal. The histogram is unimodal and approximately symmetric, though there are outliers.\nJustification against: No, the distribution does not appear to be normal because there are outliers on the right tail.\nCalculate the sample mean of raw wages in 2008. Assume that the true distribution of wages in 2008 is normal with mean 100 and standard deviation 38. What is the probability that a worker selected at random has a wage greater than or equal to this sample mean?\n\n\nWage.2008 |&gt; \n  summarise(mean(wage))\n\n  mean(wage)\n1    113.552\n\n1-pnorm(113.552,100,38)\n\n[1] 0.3606838\n\n\n\nContinue to assume that the true distribution of wages in 2008 is normal with mean 100 and standard deviation 38. Calculate the following quantities:\n\n\n95% of the workers in the population have a wage above what value?\nThe middle 50% of workers in the population have wages between which two values?\nWhat is the probability that a worker selected at random from this population has a wage above 250 OR below 50?\n\n\nqnorm(0.05,100,38)\n\n[1] 37.49556\n\nqnorm(0.25,100,38)\n\n[1] 74.36939\n\nqnorm(0.75,100,38)\n\n[1] 125.6306\n\npnorm(50,100,38)+(1-pnorm(250,100,38))\n\n[1] 0.09416186\n\n\n\nLet’s assume that the conditions hold for the central limit theorem to apply, and assume the population distribution above (normal with \\(\\mu\\) = 100 and \\(\\sigma\\) = 38). Write the distribution of \\(\\bar{X}\\), the sample mean of raw wages in 2008, in mathematical notation by replacing each “*”: \\(\\bar{X} \\sim N(100,38/\\sqrt{388})\\)\nCalculate the following quantities:\n\n\nthe probability that the sample mean of a random sample of size 388 is less than 90\nthe probability that the sample mean of a random sample of size 388 is greater than 200\nthe values that designate the middle 95% of the distribution of the sample mean for a sample of size 388\n\n\nstdev &lt;- 38/sqrt(388)\npnorm(90,100,stdev)\n\n[1] 1.088163e-07\n\n1-pnorm(200,100,stdev)\n\n[1] 0\n\nqnorm(0.025,100,stdev)\n\n[1] 96.21892\n\nqnorm(0.975,100,stdev)\n\n[1] 103.7811\n\n\n\nNow say that we are able to collect another sample that has information on twice as many workers as the 2008 sample size in this dataset. How would the values calculated in the third bullet above (in exercise 5) change? You don’t need to calculate the values; simply state if the probabilities would be larger or smaller and if the values for the middle 95% of the distribution would be closer to the mean or further from the mean.\n\nDoubling the sample size would make the standard deviation of the distribution of the sample mean smaller. This would concentrate the density closer to the mean, so the first probability will be smaller, the second probability will be smaller, and the values for the middle 95% of the distribution will move closer to the mean.\n\nIf you know that the true distribution of 2008 wages is right skewed instead of normally distributed, does the central limit theorem still apply? Why or why not?\n\nYes because the population distribution doesn’t matter if the sample is large enough.",

Therefore, the t-distribution has only a single parameter: degrees of freedom. The degrees of freedom describes the precise form of the bell-shaped t-distribution.

You must show your work/justify your answers to receive credit.\nClick here to download the template (right click and choose “save link as”)\n \nQuestions 2-5 use the births14 dataset in the openintro package. Read about the dataset and reference the codebook here\n\n(6 points) First, do some initial data exploration:\na. How many observations and how many variables are in the dataset? What does each row represent (i.e., what is the observational unit?)\nb. Which variables, if any, contain missing data?\nc. What is the count and percentage of low birth weight vs not low birth weight babies?\n\n \n\n(10 points) Is the median birth weight different when the mother smokes? Conduct a hypothesis test to investigate:\na. Write the null and alternative hypotheses.\nb. Calculate the observed statistic.\nc. Simulate the null distribution and calculate the p-value. Interpret the p-value in the context of the problem.\nd. Generate a bootstrap confidence interval and interpret the interval.\ne. Generate a plot to illustrate the median birth weight when the mother smokes vs doesn’t smoke.\n \n(8 points) Is there a relationship between premature birth and low birth weight? Conduct a hypothesis test to investigate:\na. Create a 2x2 table to show the counts of the two relevant variables\nb. What are the necessary conditions to conduct a Chi-square test of independence, and are those conditions met?\nc. Conduct the appropriate test. Write the null and alternative hypotheses, calculate and report the p-value, and interpret it in the context of the problem.\nd. Generate a plot to illustrate the relationship between premature birth and low birth weight.\n \n(10 points) Is there a relationship between hospital visits during pregnancy and mean mother’s age? Conduct a hypothesis test to investigate:\na. Create a new variable that categorizes the number of visits as: 10 or fewer, 11-15, more than 15\nb. Calculate the mean of mother’s age for each of the visit categories that you created in part a.\nc. What is the appropriate test to assess the research question? Write the null and alternative hypotheses.\nd. Conduct the appropriate test; calculate and report the p-value and interpret it in the context of the problem.\ne. Generate a plot to illustrate the relationship between mother’s age and the categorized visit variable."
