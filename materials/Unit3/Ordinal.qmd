## Upcoming deadlines

-   Project Proposal: Sunday, Nov 17 11:59 PM
-   HW 5: Sunday, Nov 24 11:59 PM

## Learning Objectives

-   Identify when to use an ordinal regression model

-   Interpret an ordinal regression model

-   Generate an ordinal regression model in R

## Class Prep

Watch the three videos about ordinal regression. Dr. Väisänan does a great job of explaining ordinal regression, though the code is in Stata. Focus on the concepts and we will cover the R code for ordinal regression in class.

Note: Make sure you are completing the class prep before each class. Quizzes can still be held to check your comprehension of the concepts covered in the videos.
