## Upcoming deadlines

-   HW 3 10/13 11:59 PM

## Learning Objectives

By the end of the class, students should be able to:

-   understand forward and backward selection

-   understand the argument against forward and backward selection

## Class prep

First read ISLR 3.2.2 part "Two: Deciding on Important Variables"

Then, read [Step Away from Stepwise](StepAwayFromStepwise.pdf) by Gary Smith. Focus on the introduction and the conclusion. After reading, you should be able to describe in general terms why Smith argues against using stepwise variable selection, particularly with large datasets.
