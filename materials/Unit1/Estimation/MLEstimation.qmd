## Upcoming deadlines

-   HW 1: Sunday, Sept 15 11:59 PM

## Learning Objectives

By the end of the class, students should be able to:

-   Identify the goal of maximum likelihood estimation

-   Define the statistical likelihood function

-   Derive a maximum likelihood estimate of a given probability distribution

## Class prep

SDS: 5.5 intro (up to 5.5.1) and 5.5.2 up to 5.5.2.1

[Supplemental YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XepXtl9YKwc) to provide some intuition for maximum likelihood estimation

By the end of the reading, you should be able to answer the following questions:

-   What are we trying to estimate?

-   What is the likelihood function?

-   How do you maximize the likelihood function? (hint: you may have to review some calculus)
