## Where do data come from?

Start with a **research question**

1.  What is the average mercury content in swordfish in the Atlantic Ocean?
2.  Does a new vaccine reduce incidence rates for a particular disease?
3.  Are average hours of sleep per night related to GPA for graduate students?

## Where do data come from?

Based on the research question, we can identify the **population of interest**.

Often, it is unrealistic to collect data on the entire population, so we collect a **sample**.

But how?

## Sampling

Say I want five of you to come to the front of the class. How could I choose five people?

## Random sampling strategies

1.  Simple random sampling
2.  Stratified sampling
3.  Cluster sampling
4.  Multistage sampling

## Simple random sampling

-   Gold standard, but not always practical

-   Many statistical methods assume simple random sampling

## Stratified sampling

![](stratified.png){fig-align="center"}

-   Useful when the sizes of the strata differ from each other

-   Useful when the cases in each stratum are very similar with respect to the outcome

## Cluster sampling

![](cluster.png){fig-align="center"}

-   Can be more economical than SRS or stratified sampling

-   Most helpful when there is case-to-case variability within a cluster, but there is not much variability among the clusters themselves

## Multistage sampling

-   Same pros as cluster sampling

## Example

**RQ**: What is the mean salary for all MLB players?

1.  What is the population of interest?
2.  How could we collect a simple random sample?
3.  How could we collect a stratified sample?
4.  How could we collect a cluster sample?

## Study Design

Broadly speaking, there are two kinds of studies:

1.  Experiments: studies where the researchers assign treatments
2.  Observational: studies where no treatment has been explicitly applied

. . .

Under which design would you be more comfortable drawing causal conclusions?

## Confounding variables

A **confounding variable** is one that is associated with both the explanatory and response variables

## Sampling in R

Let's try the `sample` function:

```{webr-r}
myvec <- 1:20
sample(myvec, size=3)
```

## Sampling in R

Let's try it with our survey data from last week:

```{webr-r}
survey <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anlane611/datasets/main/IDS702Bootcampsurvey2024.csv", header=TRUE)
names(survey) <- c("Timestamp","Interest","Excitement","Languages",
                       "Instrument","Siblings","AgeRange",
                       "BeachOrCabin","Sushi")
glimpse(survey)
```

## Sampling in R

```{webr-r}
#Simple random sample
survey.srs <- survey |>
  slice(sample(1:nrow(survey),size=3))
survey.srs
```

## Sampling in R

```{webr-r}
#Stratified random sample
survey.strat <- survey |>
  group_by(BeachOrCabin) |>
  slice(sample(1:n(),size=3)) |>
  ungroup()

survey.strat |> select(c("Interest","Instrument",
                         "AgeRange","BeachOrCabin"))
```

## Sampling in R

In your group, discuss how you can fill in the blanks to create a cluster sample in which you randomly select 2 values of the `Interest` variable

```{webr-r}
#first select the clusters
clusters <- sample(unique(survey$Interest), size= 2)
clusters

#now select the data for those clusters
survey.cluster <- survey |> filter(Interest %in% clusters)
head(survey.cluster)
```
